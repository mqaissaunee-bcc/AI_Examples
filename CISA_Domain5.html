Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) grants access based on job functions and organizational roles, simplifying administration and ensuring users receive appropriate permissions for their responsibilities. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) enforces strict, centrally-controlled policies using security labels and classifications, primarily used in high-security environments. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) allows resource owners to determine access permissions, providing flexibility but potentially compromising security. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) evaluates multiple attributes (user, resource, environment) to make dynamic access decisions. Effective access control implementation requires clear role definitions, regular access reviews, and adherence to the principle of least privilege to minimize security risks while enabling business functionality.",
                    example: "Example: A healthcare organization implements RBAC where doctors can access patient records and treatment systems, nurses can view assigned patient information and medication systems, but cannot access billing systems. Administrative staff can access billing and scheduling systems but cannot view medical records. Each role has carefully defined permissions that align with job responsibilities and regulatory requirements."

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) significantly enhances security by requiring multiple independent factors, making unauthorized access much more difficult even if one factor is compromised. Single Sign-On (SSO) improves user experience by allowing access to multiple systems with one authentication while maintaining security through centralized management. Biometric authentication uses unique physical characteristics like fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial recognition for strong identity verification. Password policies should balance security requirements with usability, including complexity requirements, expiration periods, and account lockout mechanisms. Modern authentication trends include passwordless authentication, adaptive authentication based on risk factors, and integration with identity federation standards.",
