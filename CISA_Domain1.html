The framework consists of three levels: Standards (mandatory requirements), Guidelines (recommended practices), and Tools & Techniques (detailed procedures). The Standards are organized into General Standards (1000 series covering independence, professional care, and competence), Performance Standards (1200 series covering planning, performance, and supervision), and Reporting Standards (1400 series covering reporting and follow-up). The ISACA Code of Professional Ethics establishes five fundamental principles that govern professional conduct: Professional competence and due care, Confidentiality, Integrity, Objectivity, and Professional behavior. These ethical principles must be applied throughout all audit activities and form the foundation of professional credibility.",

Financial audits focus on the accuracy of financial statements and effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, often required by regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley. Operational audits examine the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes and operations. Compliance audits verify adherence to laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. IT audits specifically assess technology controls, security measures, and IT governance. Performance audits evaluate whether objectives are being met efficiently and effectively. Assessments typically provide less formal assurance and may be performed by management or consultants. Reviews provide limited assurance and involve less extensive procedures than full audits. The type of engagement determines the scope, methodology, reporting requirements, and level of assurance provided.",
                    example: "Example: A SOX 404 compliance audit specifically examines internal controls over financial reporting for public companies, while a GDPR compliance audit focuses on data protection practices and privacy controls.

The process begins with understanding the business environment, including organizational structure, business processes, technology infrastructure, and regulatory requirements. Risk identification considers various sources including enterprise risk assessments, prior audit results, management concerns, industry trends, and regulatory changes. Risk assessment evaluates both the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks, considering factors like materiality, business criticality, regulatory requirements, and control environment. The audit strategy is then developed to address the highest-priority risks first, allocating appropriate resources and expertise. Risk-based planning ensures that audit efforts focus on areas where they can provide the most value to the organization and stakeholders.",
                    example: "Example: In a healthcare organization, risk-based planning might prioritize auditing patient data systems (high risk due to HIPAA requirements and data sensitivity) over the cafeteria point-of-sale system (lower risk and business impact), even though both are IT systems."

Controls can be classified by timing: Preventive controls stop problems before they occur (access controls, authorization requirements), Detective controls identify problems after they happen (monitoring, reconciliations), and Corrective controls fix problems and restore normal operations (backup/restore, incident response). Controls also vary by nature: Manual controls rely on people and provide flexibility but are subject to human error and override, while Automated controls are performed by systems and provide consistency but may be bypassed. Application controls are built into specific business applications to ensure complete, accurate, and authorized transaction processing, while General controls provide the foundation for the IT environment and support application controls. When evaluating controls, auditors must consider design effectiveness (whether the control addresses the risk) and operating effectiveness (whether the control is functioning as designed).",
                    example: "Example: In a purchase-to-pay process, preventive controls include purchase order approval requirements and vendor master file maintenance. Detective controls include three-way matching of purchase orders, receipts, and invoices. Corrective controls include processes for handling exceptions and disputed invoices."

The audit plan should clearly articulate audit objectives, scope boundaries, risk assessment results, materiality considerations, audit approach and methodology, resource requirements, timeline, and key deliverables. Documentation must be sufficient to enable an experienced auditor to understand the planning decisions and rationale. Communication with stakeholders is essential throughout planning to ensure alignment of expectations, secure necessary resources, address concerns, and manage scope changes. Key stakeholders typically include audit committee members, senior management, process owners, IT personnel, and external parties when relevant. Regular planning updates may be necessary as new information becomes available or circumstances change. Proper planning documentation and communication helps ensure audit success and stakeholder satisfaction.",
                    example: "Example: The audit plan document should include executive summary, background and context, audit objectives and scope, risk assessment summary, audit approach and methodology, resource requirements and timeline, key stakeholders and communication plan, expected deliverables and reporting schedule, and any scope limitations or dependencies."

For IT audits, materiality considerations extend beyond financial impact to include operational disruption, regulatory violations, security breaches, and reputational damage. Quantitative materiality might be based on financial metrics, transaction volumes, or system capacity, while qualitative materiality considers strategic importance, regulatory sensitivity, and stakeholder concerns. The audit universe represents all auditable entities within the organization's scope and should be regularly updated to reflect organizational changes, new systems, emerging risks, and regulatory requirements. Audit universe development involves identifying all business processes, IT systems, locations, vendors, and other auditable areas, then assessing and prioritizing them based on risk, materiality, and audit frequency requirements. This forms the foundation for multi-year audit planning and resource allocation decisions.",

Statistical sampling uses probability theory to select items and evaluate results, providing mathematical measures of sampling risk and enabling projections to the population. Non-statistical sampling relies on auditor judgment for both selection and evaluation but must still be representative. Key sampling concepts include population definition (what items are subject to testing), sampling unit (individual items being selected), sample size determination (based on risk, materiality, and desired confidence), selection method (random, systematic, stratified), and result evaluation (determining conclusions about the population). Different sampling methods serve different purposes: Random sampling gives each item equal chance of selection, Systematic sampling selects every nth item, Stratified sampling divides population into subgroups and samples each, and Cluster sampling selects groups of items. Proper sampling methodology is essential for drawing valid audit conclusions.",
                    example: "Example: When testing user access reviews, stratified sampling might divide users into executives (high risk), managers (medium risk), and staff (lower risk), then sample from each stratum to ensure all risk levels are tested, rather than simple random sampling which might miss high-risk executives due to their small numbers."

The reliability of evidence varies by source and nature: Evidence obtained directly by the auditor is most reliable, followed by evidence from independent external sources, internal documentary evidence, and oral representations (least reliable). Electronic evidence presents unique challenges including data integrity, completeness, and accessibility concerns. Auditors must understand system controls, data extraction methods, and electronic evidence authentication to properly evaluate computer-generated information.",
                    example: "Example: When testing accounts payable, inquiry involves asking staff about approval procedures, observation involves watching the three-way matching process, inspection involves examining purchase orders and invoices, reperformance involves independently performing the matching process, and confirmation involves directly contacting vendors to verify balances."

Common audit analytics include duplicate testing, gap analysis, Benford's Law analysis, ratio analysis, trend analysis, and regression analysis. Data analytics tools range from basic spreadsheet functions to sophisticated specialized software like ACL, IDEA, or Tableau. However, analytics require careful consideration of data quality, completeness, accuracy, and relevance. Auditors must understand data sources, extraction methods, transformation processes, and analytical limitations to properly interpret results and draw appropriate conclusions.",

Report structure typically includes executive summary, audit objectives and scope, methodology overview, detailed findings with conditions/criteria/causes/effects, conclusions, and recommendations. Communication techniques vary by audience: Audit committees need high-level summaries focused on significant risks, management needs detailed findings with specific remediation guidance, and operational personnel need clear, actionable recommendations.

Professional competence and due care requires maintaining current knowledge, skills, and understanding of developments in IS audit practice, applying appropriate professional judgment, and performing work with diligence. This includes obtaining sufficient relevant evidence to support findings and recommendations, properly planning and supervising audit work, and maintaining competence through continuing professional education. Confidentiality requires respecting the confidentiality of information acquired during professional work and not using such information for personal benefit or in a manner that would be detrimental to legitimate objectives. Integrity demands honesty and straightforwardness in all professional relationships, refusing to be associated with reports or communications that are misleading, and disclosure of material facts when necessary. Objectivity requires maintaining mental independence and avoiding conflicts of interest that could compromise professional judgment. Professional behavior means complying with relevant laws and regulations, conducting oneself in a manner that reflects positively on the profession, and refusing to engage in activities that could discredit the profession.",

Independence threats include Self-interest threats (financial relationships or dependencies), Self-review threats (auditing own work or decisions), Advocacy threats (promoting client interests), Familiarity threats (close personal relationships), and Intimidation threats (pressure from clients or others). Common safeguards include organizational independence (reporting to audit committee rather than management), professional standards and oversight, rotation of audit personnel, independent review of audit work, and clear policies prohibiting certain relationships. When independence threats cannot be reduced to acceptable levels through safeguards, the auditor must decline the engagement or remove themselves from specific audit areas. Independence considerations extend beyond the individual auditor to include audit firm relationships and financial interests.",

Professional skepticism is a critical attitude that includes maintaining a questioning mind throughout the audit, being alert to conditions that may indicate misstatement due to error or fraud, critically assessing audit evidence, and not accepting explanations without corroborating evidence. Professional skepticism does not mean assuming dishonesty but rather maintaining independence of mind and not accepting assertions without proper verification. These concepts work together to ensure audit quality: due professional care provides the foundation of competent performance, while professional skepticism ensures critical evaluation of evidence and conclusions.",
