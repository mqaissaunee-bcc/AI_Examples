It serves as the foundation for project decision-making and should be continuously updated throughout the project lifecycle. Key components include executive summary, business need and opportunity, proposed solution options, cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, implementation approach, and success criteria. The business case must align with organizational strategy and demonstrate how the project will deliver value. Financial justification typically includes Net Present Value (NPV), Return on Investment (ROI), and payback period calculations. Non-financial benefits such as improved customer satisfaction, regulatory compliance, or competitive advantage should also be quantified where possible.

The Waterfall model follows sequential phases (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance) and works well for projects with stable, well-defined requirements. Agile methodologies emphasize iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability to change, making them ideal for projects with evolving requirements. The Spiral model combines iterative development with systematic risk analysis, suitable for large, complex projects with significant risks. Rapid Application Development (RAD) focuses on quick delivery through prototyping and user involvement. The V-Model emphasizes verification and validation activities corresponding to each development phase. DevOps integrates development and operations for continuous delivery. Selection depends on project characteristics, organizational culture, risk tolerance, and stakeholder preferences.",

Functional requirements describe what the system should do (business processes, user interactions, system functions), while non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform (performance, security, usability, reliability). Requirements gathering techniques include interviews, workshops, surveys, observation, document analysis, and prototyping. Requirements must be clear, complete, consistent, verifiable, and traceable. Requirements management involves establishing baselines, controlling changes, maintaining traceability, and ensuring requirements are met throughout development. Poor requirements are a leading cause of project failure, making this phase critical for success. Requirements should be prioritized using techniques like MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to manage scope and expectations.",
                    example: "Example: For an online banking system, functional requirements might include 'User can transfer funds between accounts' while non-functional requirements include 'System must process transactions within 3 seconds' and 'System must be available 99.9% of the time'."

Project management involves planning, executing, monitoring, and controlling project activities to achieve objectives within scope, time, budget, and quality constraints. Essential project management components include Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), project schedule, resource allocation, risk management, quality management, and stakeholder management. Project success criteria should be defined upfront and include both delivery measures (scope, schedule, budget) and outcome measures (business benefits, user satisfaction). Regular governance reviews ensure projects remain aligned with business objectives and organizational priorities.",

Performance testing evaluates system response times, throughput, and scalability under various load conditions. Security testing identifies vulnerabilities and ensures appropriate controls are implemented. Regression testing ensures new changes don't break existing functionality. Test planning should define test objectives, scope, approach, resources, schedule, and success criteria. Automated testing tools can improve efficiency and consistency for repetitive tests.",

Direct (Big Bang) implementation involves complete immediate switchover, providing fastest implementation but highest risk. Risk mitigation strategies include comprehensive testing, thorough training, detailed rollback procedures, and adequate support resources. Implementation planning should address data conversion, user training, system documentation, support procedures, and contingency plans. Success factors include strong project management, effective communication, appropriate resource allocation, and stakeholder commitment.",

Migration planning should address data volume, complexity, conversion timing, validation procedures, and rollback requirements. Critical considerations include maintaining data relationships, preserving historical data, handling data format differences, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Data conversion testing should include volume testing, accuracy validation, and end-to-end process verification. Backup and recovery procedures are essential in case conversion issues occur. Documentation should capture conversion procedures, validation results, and any data modifications for audit purposes.",

Each phase must be completed before the next begins, with extensive documentation at each stage. This approach works well for projects with stable, well-defined requirements and regulatory compliance needs. However, it lacks flexibility for changing requirements and delays feedback until late in the process. Agile methodologies, in contrast, emphasize iterative development, customer collaboration, working software over documentation, and responding to change. Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban enable frequent delivery of working software increments, continuous stakeholder feedback, and adaptive planning. Agile is ideal for projects with evolving requirements, innovative solutions, and need for rapid delivery. The choice between approaches depends on project characteristics, organizational culture, stakeholder preferences, and risk tolerance.",

Microservices architecture breaks applications into small, independent services that can be developed and deployed separately. Container technologies like Docker enable consistent deployment across environments. Monitoring and logging provide visibility into application performance and user behavior.

The critical path is the longest path through the network. Gantt charts provide visual representation of project schedules, showing task durations, dependencies, and resource assignments. Schedule management includes developing the project schedule, monitoring progress, and managing changes. Techniques for schedule optimization include fast tracking (performing activities in parallel), crashing (adding resources to critical path activities), and resource leveling (adjusting schedule to optimize resource utilization). Schedule risks should be identified and mitigated through contingency planning and buffer time allocation.",

Impact analysis should consider effects on project timeline, budget, resources, quality, and stakeholder satisfaction. Approved changes must be communicated to all affected stakeholders and integrated into project plans. Configuration management ensures all project deliverables are properly versioned and controlled.

                    "Proceed with cutover as planned since rollback is rarely needed",
                    "Test rollback procedures before production cutover",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Untested rollback procedures may fail when needed, potentially causing extended business disruption. Rollback procedures should be tested to ensure they work correctly and can be executed within required timeframes if implementation issues occur."
