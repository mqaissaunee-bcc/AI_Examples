                    "A) Virtual LAN - Segmentation and broadcast domain reduction",
                    "B) Verified LAN - Enhanced security only",

                ],
                correct: "A",
                explanation: "A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) logically segments networks regardless of physical location. Benefits include: reduced broadcast domains, improved security through isolation, better performance, and simplified network management without physical cable changes."

                    "A) create vlan 10 name Sales",

                ],
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "The correct commands are: 'vlan 10' (enters VLAN configuration mode) followed by 'name Sales'. The full sequence is: Switch(config)# vlan 10, Switch(config-vlan)# name Sales. This creates VLAN 10 and assigns it a descriptive name."
            },

                ],
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Trunk ports carry traffic for multiple VLANs between switches, routers, or other network devices. They use tagging (typically 802.1Q) to identify which VLAN each frame belongs to, enabling inter-switch VLAN communication."
            },

                    "A) To encrypt all VLAN traffic",
                    "B) To carry untagged frames",
                    "C) To block unauthorized VLANs",

                ],
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "The native VLAN (default VLAN 1) carries untagged frames on an 802.1Q trunk. Frames from the native VLAN are not tagged when sent across the trunk, and untagged frames received are assumed to belong to the native VLAN. Both ends must have matching native VLANs."

                ],
                correct: "C",
                explanation: "DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol) is a Cisco proprietary protocol that automatically negotiates trunking on links between switches. Modes include: dynamic auto, dynamic desirable, trunk, and access. Best practice is to disable DTP and manually configure trunk/access ports."

                ],
                correct: "A",
                explanation: "Inter-VLAN routing enables communication between different VLANs, which are separate broadcast domains by default. Without it, devices in different VLANs cannot communicate. It can be accomplished using: router-on-a-stick, Layer 3 switch (SVI), or dedicated router interfaces."
            },

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Router-on-a-stick uses a single physical router interface with multiple logical subinterfaces (one per VLAN) connected to a trunk port. Each subinterface is configured with an IP address in the respective VLAN's subnet and handles inter-VLAN routing. Example: interface Gi0/0.10 for VLAN 10."
